# kryptojobstogo

This KryptoJobs2Go is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them.

The first file is called `krypto_jobs.py`. It contains the code associated with the web interface of application. The code included in this file is compatible with the Streamlit library.

The second file  is called `crypto_wallet.py`. This file contains the Ethereum transaction functions that we have created throughout this moduleâ€™s lessons. By using import statements, we will integrate the `crypto_wallet.py` Python script into the KryptoJobs2Go interface program that is found in the `krypto_jobs.py` file.

Integrating these two files will allow us to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via a personal Ethereum blockchain called Ganache.
